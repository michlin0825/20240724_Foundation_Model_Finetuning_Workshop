Kohli has also contributed to a number of India's victories, including the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions Trophy.\\n\\nKohli was born and raised in New Delhi, where he attended the West Delhi Cricket Academy and began his junior career with the Delhi Under-15 team. He made his international debut in 2008 and soon established himself as a prominent member of the ODI team, eventually making his Test debut in 2011. For the first time, Kohli topped the ICC ODI batting rankings in 2013. During the 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a competition record for the most runs scored. In 2018, he became the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one place in all three versions of the game. \\nIn 2019, he became the first player to score 20,000 international runs in a single decade. Following the T20 World Cup in 2021, Kohli decided to step down as captain of the Indian national team for T20Is, and he stood down as captain of the Test team in early 2022.\\n\\n\\nHe has garnered numerous awards for his achievements on the cricket pitch. He was named the ICC One-Day International Player of the Year in 2012 and has twice won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, which is awarded to the ICC Cricketer of the Year, in 2017 and 2018. Kohli was the best run scorer in the 2012 Asia Cup, scoring 357 runs. Kohli was also named ICC Test Player of the Year and ICC ODI Player of the Year in 2018, making him the first player to get both honours in the same year. In addition, from 2016 to 2018, he was crowned the Wisden Top Cricketer in the World for three years in a row. Kohli received the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri in the sports category in 2017, and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna medal, India's highest sporting honour, in 2018.</td>\n",
